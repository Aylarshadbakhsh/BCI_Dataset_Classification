# BCI Classification Project: Motor Imagery (MI) and SSVEP-based EEG Signals
This project focuses on classifying EEG signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, specifically using Motor Imagery (MI) and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigms.
The goal is to differentiate between various mental states, such as left- and right-hand imagery, or to identify visual stimulus responses using SSVEP data. The project employs various machine learning
and deep learning techniques
